# Plugin Usage

## Commands
Plugin files share all of the commands that a regular story or area file have.
There are some unique commands as well:

- Functions
  - Example:
    - ```
      func example {
        text: This is an example function!
      }
      ```
  - Usage:
    - ```
      func [function name] {
        [commands]
        ...
      }
      ```
